Welcome to my webpage! I am a machine learning researcher, statistician, and professional curious person. 
<!-- Currently, I'm excited to be part of the team at [Altos Labs](http://altoslabs.com), where I'm working on developing machine learning methods that contribute to Altos' mission of transforming medicine through cellular rejuvenation programming. -->
Previously, I had the opportunity to work as a Research Scientist at Improbable, where I gained valuable experience applying my skills to real-world problems. During my time at Improbable, I also served as an Assistant Professor in Statistics at Durham University, where I enjoyed contributing to the academic community and mentoring the next generation of statisticians and machine learning practitioners.
My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and probability theory, with a particular focus on applications in the sciences. I'm also intrigued by the philosophical aspects of science and enjoy digging into the foundations when the opportunity arises. Recently, I've been working on projects involving generative AI, including large language models, embeddings, and diffusion models.
I obtained my DPhil (the Oxford equivalent of a PhD) from the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. Below, you'll find a list of my publications, highlighting my contributions to the field.
