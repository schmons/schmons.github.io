Welcome to my webpage. I am a machine learning researcher, statistician and professional curious person. I am currently at [Altos Labs](http://altoslabs.com), working on machine learning methods that help the Altos mission to "transform medicine through cellular rejuvenation programming". 
Before moving to industry full-time, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Statistics at Durham University and a Research Scientist in the Research team at Improbable. My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, machine learning and probability as well as applications to the sciences, but I also don't shy away from the occasional excursion into the philosophy of science. My recent work involves, for instance, work on generative AI including large language models, embeddings and diffusion models. A list of publications can be found below. I obtained my DPhil (Oxford parlance for PhD) at the Department of Statistics of the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/).
